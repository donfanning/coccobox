Historical ATT Dialer for massive CC social engineering from the '90s

Historical phreaking software from mid 1998 for US calling-card and credit card acquisition trough automated social engineering.

The AT&T Dialer, friendly named coccobox, is in the file zio.scl.

The software was massively dialing US phone numbers with collect-calls trough international AT&T access gateway.

It was run from Italy using the so called "country direct" 172-1011 to get into the ATT IVR.

The automated AT&T system was asking the reason for the callect call, to be then replayed once connected to the destination phone number.

The software at that stage was playing "Emergency From Hospital (file emer-f.wav).

As the called party accepted the collect call, the software played a wave about a problem with the phone billing, asking to insert the credit card or calling card in order to accept the collect call.

As the called party inserted the credit card or calling card, those DTMF would be captured by the modem and saved.


## Old instructions Notes

Call 1721011,,numero di telfono#,0##,111

When say caller, at the tone, please say your name, play the first wave.
If the other party accept it, you send the second wave.
If the other party stay on the line, play the third wave.
Then the model will collect the credit card or calling card by the DTMF being played.
If you are lucky, over 100 calls, you can get 4 cards.
