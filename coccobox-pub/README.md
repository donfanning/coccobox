# coccobox
Historical phreaking software from mid 1998 for US calling-card and credit card acquisition trough automated social engineering.

The AT&T Dialer, friendly named coccobox, is in the file [zio.scl](https://github.com/x25today/coccobox/blob/main/coccobox/zio.scl) .

The software was massively dialing US phone numbers with collect-calls trough international AT&T access gateway, from Italy using the so called "country direct" 172-1011 .

The automated AT&T system was asking the reason for the callect call, to be then replayed once connected to the destination phone number.

The software at that stage was playing [Emergency From Hospital](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x25today/coccobox/main/coccobox/emer-f.wav) .


## Old instructions

Call 1721011,,numero di telfono#,0##,111

When say caller, at the tone, please say your name, play the first wave.
If the other party accept it, you send the second wave.
If the other party stay on the line, play the third wave.
Then the model will collect the credit card or calling card by the DTMF being played.
If you are lucky, over 100 calls, you can get 4 cards.
